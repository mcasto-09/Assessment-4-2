This project, albiet unfinished, has some functionality to it. Supposed to be a twitter clone, you are able to count likes on the post, alongside repost the image. 
While not finished, has taught me a lot about React, going from neutrality to highly enjoying the process and simplicity. I hope to come back to it another time and make it fully functional
To run this project, simply type npm run dev
